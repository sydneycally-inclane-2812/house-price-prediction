**Project Title: House Price Predictor**

**Description**

This project aims to predict housing prices in Ho Chi Minh City using machine learning techniques implemented in Python.  The workflow involves data scraping, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and model building to deliver insights into the factors driving housing prices. Different inference models were used and compared, and the same technique is also used on publicly available datasets for quality assessment.

**Key Libraries**

* **Pandas:**  Data manipulation and analysis.
* **Beautiful Soup:**  Web scraping for collecting real estate data.
* **Matplotlib:** Creating visualizations to understand price trends and feature relationships.
* **Scikit-learn:** Building various machine learning models and evaluating their performance.
